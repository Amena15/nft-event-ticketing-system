## 📖 Overview

The **NFT Event Ticketing System** is a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) that allows event organizers to mint NFT-based tickets and users to securely purchase and verify them on the Ethereum blockchain. This project solves issues like fraud, ticket scalping, and loss of proof-of-purchase through the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology.

## ✅ Features

- 🎫 Mint NFT tickets for events
- 👤 Organizer and attendee roles
- 🔒 Secure blockchain-based ticket verification
- 🔄 Resell and transfer tickets with ownership tracking
- 🖼️ Metadata support (images, descriptions)
- 📦 Smart contract deployment using Hardhat

- **Frontend** interacts with users through MetaMask.
- **Smart contracts** manage ticket minting, transfer, and ownership.
- **Blockchain** provides verifiability and decentralization.

## 🔐 Smart Contracts

The system includes two main contracts:

1. **Event.sol**  
   - Handles event creation and metadata.

2. **NFTticketing.sol**  
   - Handles NFT ticket minting, verification, and transfer.

Contracts are written in **Solidity**, compiled and tested using **Hardhat**.
